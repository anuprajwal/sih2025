This cycle file represents an ocean profile collected by an Argo float in the Indian Ocean, at a location near latitude –9.857° and longitude 55.953°. The measurements were recorded on 11 November 2002 in the morning hours, with data extending from just below the sea surface at about 5.5 dbar down to nearly 2000 dbar, which corresponds roughly to 2000 meters depth. In total, 45 depth levels were sampled during this profile.

The key variables recorded are pressure (PRES), temperature (TEMP), and salinity (PSAL). Pressure values provide the depth reference for all measurements, showing how the float descended through the water column. The temperature profile begins around 27.4 °C at the surface and steadily decreases with depth, reaching close to 2.6 °C in the deep ocean. This trend reflects the typical thermal structure of the ocean, with a warm mixed layer near the surface, a sharp thermocline where temperature rapidly declines, and a cold, stable deep-water layer.

Salinity measurements start at about 35.4 PSU near the surface and gradually decrease with depth, reaching around 34.7 PSU in the deeper layers. This slight freshening at depth is also consistent with large-scale ocean circulation patterns. Together, the temperature and salinity distributions give insight into water mass characteristics and stratification at this location and time.
